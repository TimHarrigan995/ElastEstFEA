A few years ago I collabrated with one of the best people working in Elastography, Elisa Konofagou, to adapt the bone remodeling code 
I was working with to predict elastiic modulus distributions.  There are other methods to accomplish this, but the stability and the
mathematical background was interesting enough to get it published in J Biomechanics.  I've updated the code using Eclipse on an 
ubuntu 24.04 operating system, and the results are stable for the cases I've tested.
This repository has the published paper, some sample input files, and the code.
